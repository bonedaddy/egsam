# 4 TLS

Use of TLS for Gemini transactions is mandatory.

Use of the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension to TLS is also
mandatory, to facilitate name-based virtual hosting.
```

▶️ Pass :) You would not be able to see this page if client was not using TLS or SNI as this server uses name-based virtual hosting.
